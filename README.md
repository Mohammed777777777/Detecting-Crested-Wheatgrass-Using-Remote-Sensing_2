# Detecting-Crested-Wheatgrass-Using-Remote-Sensing_2
This repository will contain code from the third chapter.  I have uploaded the scripts along with the Excel/CSV files that are required to run the scripts. Please take a look at the extended description of each script to understand what it does.


This is the GEE JavaScript files that were created to formulate the time series data using both PlanetScope and Sentinel data. These GEE links will have the the assest links along with the scripts, which is why it is easier to share the links only.
